TERAFIELD RESOURCES - DAILY SHIFT HANDOVER REPORT
================================================================================

Date: October 12, 2023
Shift: Day Shift (06:00 - 18:00)
Operator: Mike Johnson
Relief Operator: Sarah Chen
Weather: Clear, 78°F

================================================================================
FACILITY STATUS SUMMARY
================================================================================

Midland Hub Status: OPERATIONAL
Overall Production: 12,450 BOPD (97% of target)

Equipment Status:
- TF-V-204: OPERATIONAL (watching closely - see notes)
- TF-V-205: OPERATIONAL  
- TF-H-301: OPERATIONAL
- TF-COMP-LP-A: OPERATIONAL (vibration within limits)
- TF-MID-HUB: OPERATIONAL

================================================================================
OPERATOR NOTES - IMPORTANT
================================================================================

1. VALVE ISSUE - TF-V-204
   Operator Note: Bypass valve on V-204 sticks when pressure exceeds 550. 
   Recommend replacement. Had to manually cycle it twice this shift when 
   upstream pressure spiked to 560 PSI around 14:30.
   
   Action: Called maintenance, they will inspect during next turnaround.
   Workaround: Reduced choke on northern wells to keep inlet < 540 PSI.

2. COMPRESSOR VIBRATION
   TF-COMP-LP-A showing 0.35 in/sec vibration on bearing #2.
   Within limits (0.5 max) but trending up from 0.28 last week.
   Recommend predictive maintenance check within 2 weeks.

3. NORTHERN GATHERING LINE
   Noticed slight pressure buildup in 6" line from northern leases.
   Possible scale accumulation. Added to pigging schedule for next month.

SAFETY & ENVIRONMENTAL
================================================================================

- No safety incidents
- No environmental releases
- Daily H2S checks: All clear
- Fire extinguisher inspection: Complete

================================================================================
MAINTENANCE REQUESTS SUBMITTED
================================================================================

1. MT-2023-4421 (OPEN): V-204 bypass valve replacement - HIGH PRIORITY
2. MT-2023-4456 (NEW): TF-COMP-LP-A bearing inspection
3. MT-2023-4457 (NEW): Northern line pigging

================================================================================
ITEMS FOR INCOMING SHIFT
================================================================================

1. Monitor V-204 inlet pressure closely - keep below 540 PSI
2. Check compressor vibration readings at 20:00 and 02:00
3. Expect tanker truck at 22:00 for water disposal
4. Engineering team visiting tomorrow AM for integration assessment
